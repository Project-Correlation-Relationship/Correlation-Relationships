# Creation and Publication of Correlation Relationships

This page has been created to give you the opportunity to download and engage with the correlations we've created thus far. We value your feedback so please answer the questions below and share any thoughts or suggestions you may have.
The purpose of the correlation relationships published is to demonstrate the importance of recognising correlation relationship data model for practical applications, and thus propose it to data producers, software vendors, and researchers to consider it for adoption.

Note that the Correlation Relationships produced are experimental data and fall under the Experimental Statistics category. The methodologies used to develop the correlations are under development and would require further extensive testing. 

This means that the data:
- may not be complete or fully developed;
- may contain inaccuracies; and
- could be subject to changes based on user feedback.

Note that there is no guarantee as yet on whether participating partner bodies will continue to be able to generate the correlations.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has a useful 
[Guide to Experimental Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/guidetoexperimentalstatistics).

### How you can help

We would be very grateful for any input or comments that you may have but specifically would welcome your thoughts on the following questions:

1.	Is anything missing from this data model?
2.	Is there anything that would need to be changed in order for your organisation to consider adopting?
3.	Which aspects do you consider the most valuable to your organisation and users?
4.	Do you have any suggestions for how we can maximise future engagement with this work?
5.	What other correlation relationships could be of interest to you?
6.	What other correlation relationship data models do you know of that we could possibly research?
