# Creation and Publication of Correlation Relationships

This page has been created to give you the opportunity to download and engage with the correlations we've created thus far. We value your feedback so please answer the questions below and share any thoughts or suggestions you may have.
The purpose of the correlation relationships published is to demonstrate the importance of recognising correlation relationship data model for practical applications, and thus propose it to data producers, software vendors, and researchers to consider it for adoption.

Note that the Correlation Relationships produced are experimental data and fall under the Experimental Statistics category. The methodologies used to develop the correlations are under development and would require further extensive testing. 

This means that the data:
- may not be complete or fully developed;
- may contain inaccuracies; and
- could be subject to changes based on user feedback.

Note that there is no guarantee as yet on whether participating partner bodies will continue to be able to generate the correlations.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has a useful 
[Guide to Experimental Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/guidetoexperimentalstatistics).
