## Description
Under the Local Government Finance Act, the VOA publishes a list of the non-domestic rates for properties and the constituent parts of the properties.[[1]](https://voaratinglists.blob.core.windows.net/html/rlidata.htm)

In the VOA data model, a property is defined as the geographical area or point feature that is under the legal control of a tax payer (NB: control rights are not same as ownership rights). The geographical area of a property (say a shopping mall) could include areas occupied by built structures (e.g. main warehouse and shop) but also adjacent open spaces (e.g. car parks, bike racks).

Each property is assigned a highly descriptive address and a Unique Address Reference Number (UARN) which are primarily aimed at VOA valuers so that they are be able to locate a property manually with mapping aids and also gain insight of any relevant local context. For example, an address for a Mobile Phone Mast is: “ROOF TOP (SHARED 163368) AT CLEVEDON TELEPHONE EXCHANGE, ALBERT ROAD, CLEVEDON, BS21 7RW”, and “PORTLIN TEA ROOMS (BENEATH CAPTAINS CABIN) 51, BIRNBECK ROAD, WESTON-SUPER-MARE, BS23 2EE” is an address for a coffee shop.

Despite the meaningful nature of the example addresses, VOA's addresses are not based on commonly used postal addressing standards, e.g. ISO 19160-4:2017[[2]](https://www.iso.org/standard/64242.html), BS7666[[3]](https://www.agi.org.uk/agi-groups/standards-committee/bs7666-guidelines), and others. The business rates list also doesn’t provide a geospatial representation (e.g. polygonal or point feature) of the property. To locate the VOA property on a map, the eligible and licensed users of Non-Domestic Building Rates list, published by the VOA, rely on their understanding of the VOA property definition, and on OS AddressBase Premium (ABP)[[4]](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/addressbase-premium).

The correlation contains the following sets of information:
- A lookup between VOA UARN and a BS7666 based address - the latter been generated by the local authority. Each address in OS ABP is assigned a Unique Property Reference Number. The UARN-UPRN lookup is available in the “Application Cross Reference” or also called “Type 23” records of the OS ABP. The UARN-UPRN lookup is based largely on automated matching of the VOA UARN address and Local Authority Address.

- A link between UPRN and Basic Land and Property Unit (BLPU), which is a real-world geographical feature captured in the OSMM Topographic Area dataset. But the OSMM Topographic Area does not always contain a polygon for all BLPU e.g. shops in a mall buildings because OSMM Topographic area doesn’t cover indoor spaces.
It is therefore possible to only make an approximate link between a UPRN (linked to a BLPU) address and a VOA property. However, the link between a can be 1-MANY or MANY-MANY, and a UARN can make up all or part of the BLPU feature, as shown in Figure 1.

## Inclusion Criteria, Correlation Methodology and Confidence Metric
1. Textual: For each UARN-UPRN pair in ABP, the fields of the VOA Address are matched (using a Fuzzy String Comparer) with the fields of the UPRN Address after ensuring that the addressing fields in both addresses are comparable e.g. letter cases, field types Address comparison that have a similarity ratio of greater than 90% (i.e. only 10% mismatch) in all field matches are correlated and assigned a metric of 1. Remaining confidence metrics are as per the following table based on the mismatches

    Number of fields mismatched | Metric
    ------------ | :-------------:
    <=10% Mismatched Local Authority | 7
    Town mismatch | 6
    Street mismatch | 5
    Na | 4
    -| 3
    -| 2
    No mismatch | 1


2. Spatial Comparison: For each UARN-UPRN pair in ABP , the BLPU
