### Woodland Inventory

The National Forest Inventory (NFI) woodland map covers all forest and woodland area over 0.5 hectare with a minimum of 20% canopy cover (or the potential to achieve it) and a minimum width of 20 metres, including areas of new planting, clearfell, windblow and restocked areas. The woodland map excludes all 'tarmac' roads, rivers and powerlines where the gap in the woodland is greater than 20 meters wide. 

### Woodland Grant

The English Woodland Grant Scheme (EWGS) was launched in 2005 and offered 6 grants for the creation and stewardship of woodlands. This dataset contains the scheme or 'case' boundaries that make up the EWGS applications approved by the Forestry Commission. EWGS is now closed and was superseded by Countryside Stewardship in 2015. 

### Ancient Woodland

This is a spatial dataset that describes the geographic extent and location of ancient woodland habitat in England (excluding the Isles of Scilly). Ancient woodland is land that has had a continuous woodland cover since at least 1600 AD and may be ancient semi-natural woodland (ASNW), which retains a native tree and shrub cover that has not been planted. Iit may have been managed by coppicing or felling and allowed to regenerate naturally, or plantation on ancient woodland sites (PAWS) where the original tree cover has been felled and replaced by planting, often with conifers, and usually over the last century. In total 53,238 polygons were captured, covering approximately 364,414.53 Ha.
