### Woodland Inventory

The NFI woodland map covers all forest and woodland area over 0.5 hectare with a minimum of 20% canopy cover (or the potential to achieve it) and a minimum width of 20 metres, including areas of new planting, clearfell, windblow and restocked areas.The woodland map excludes all 'tarmac' roads, rivers and powerlines where the gap in the woodland is greater than 20 meters wide. The woodland map is continually updated on an annual basis. The changes in the canopy cover have been identified on remote sensing imagery taken during spring/summer 2017 or colour aerial orthophotographic imagery available at the time of the assessment. Additionally, new planting information from grant schemes and the FE sub-compartment database for the financial year 2017/2018 have been added to the woodland map.The changes in the woodland boundaries use the Ordnance Survey MasterMap (OSMM) as a reference where appropriated. OSMM is the most up to date large-scale digital map of GB providing a seamless database for 1:1250, 1:2500 and 1:10000 survey data.All woodland (both urban and rural, regardless of ownership) which is 0.5 hectare or greater in extent, with the exception of Assumed woodland or Low density areas that can be 0.1 hectare or greater in extend. Woodland less than 0.5 hectare in extent will not be described within the dataset but will be included in a separate sample survey of small woodland and tree features.
__Category__
1. Woodland – areas greater than 0.5 hectares that represents the extent of mapped woodland
2. Non woodland – open areas greater than 0.5 hectares completely surrounded by woodland 
__IFT Woodland areas classification__ 
1. Conifer - Coniferous woodland often occurs as large plantations with trees in regular rows and the stand edges may be regular and sharply defined. Some broadleaved trees may also be present but greater than 80% of the area will consist of conifers.
2. Broadleaved - The canopy of broadleaved woodland is generally more uneven than that of coniferous woodland being made up of rounded crowns but with variations according to species, age, height, and season. Boundaries with adjacent internal polygons are generally less clearly defined than with conifers and naturally occurring stands may grade into adjacent ones with no sharp division. Some coniferous trees may be present but greater than 80% of the area will consist of broadleaved trees. 
3. Mixed Predominantly conifer - The interpretation of Mixed woodland can be very difficult as it exhibits intermediate characteristics between Conifer and Broadleaved woodland. There can be several types of mixed woodland. A plantation of alternate rows of conifer and broadleaves may produce a 'striped' appearance. You may see conifer and broadleaves planted in blocks, and there may be general intersperse woodland. The proportion of the Conifer will be more than 50% of the area and less than 80%. 
4. Mixed Predominantly broadleaved - The interpretation of Mixed woodland can be very difficult as it exhibits intermediate characteristics between Conifer and Broadleaved woodland. There can be several types of mixed woodland. A plantation of alternate rows of conifer and broadleaves may produce a 'striped' appearance. You may see conifer and broadleaves planted in blocks, and there may be general intersperse woodland. The proportion of the Broadleaves will be more than 50% of the area and less than 80%. 
5. Coppice - The most important characteristic of coppice areas on aerial photography is very even, smooth appearance. The coppice area may be made up of a patchwork of different ages (heights) but all show this very even character. Areas recently cut may appear to have a very clear floor with little felling debris.
6. Coppice-with-Standards - Some areas of coppice also include larger broadleaved trees set in the coppice matrix. These broadleaved trees, often oak, are known as standards and show very clearly over the even coppice as large rounded crowns. The distribution of the standards may also be fairly scattered with approximately 25 per ha. 
7. Shrub - This category is intended to include areas that may possibly be woodland, where the growth is close to the ground and shows a rough character but no clear differentiation between Conifer and Broadleaved can yet be made. Areas being colonised by woody species may fall into this category. The cover will be at least 20%. 
8. Young Trees - Areas where planting is clearly visible but the trees cannot yet be allocated between Conifer and Broadleaved due to their immaturity. These areas can be on either land new to woodland or where a felled crop has been replaced. 
9. Felled - Areas of woodland where the trees have been harvested or felled. Stumps or felled trees may be visible and there may be long heaps of felling debris ('windrows'). Some standing trees within this limit may also be present but should be disregarded. The areas concerned may also have been re-stocked but the new trees are not yet visible.
10. Ground Prepared for New Planting - Land in this category is area recently converted from some other land use to woodland and will show plough furrows or mounding but the new planting (if present) cannot yet be discerned 
11. Cloud or Shadow - If cloud or shadow areas obscure woodland detail and it is difficult to allocate one of the above IFTs, and then digitise a new boundary line feature around the area of uncertain forest type. 
12. Uncertain - Where the interpreter is uncertain of the IFT/IOA to be used X will be designated. The rate of use of this category should decline over time as operators become more proficient and better at recognising IFT/IOAs. As part of the QA procedures X's will be checked and operators found using this code frequently will be subject to more intensive QA procedures and possibly more training. 
13. Low density- This category intended to include areas that have less than 20% canopy cover that might have potential to achieve woodland in the future.  These areas will be monitored in future updates and either updated to reflect forest type or removed from the dataset. 
14. Assumed woodland - The supplied grant scheme and FC new planting polygons have been attributed as 'assumed woodland' as these areas have not been checked against the latest images and will be monitored in future updates and either updated to reflect forest type or removed from the dataset. 
15. Failed - Areas that show evidence of ground prep over several years and still exhibit no evidence of tress, based on the latest available imagery. 
16. Windblow - Areas of woodland where the trees have been uprooting or broken by the wind and which remain uncleared and not regenerated based on the latest available imagery.

__Non woodland areas classification__
1.Open water - Normally labelled within OSMM, areas of even colour. 
2. Grass - A predominantly grassy area - may be agricultural or not. 
3. Agricultural land - May contain a cereal crop or pasture. 
4. Urban/Building - Buildings within woodland areas, may include gardens surrounding the building. 
5. Forest road, track - Linear feature, often fairly straight with gentle bends or turning circles. 
6. River - Linear feature, depending on location can be fairly straight or meander through woodland. 
7. Powerline - Possible shadow evidence of poles, pylons or even the cable/lines.
8. Quarry - Show change in vegetation to geology, sand, slate, rock etc. Active quarries could have buildings, heavy plant tracks leading into the quarry. 
9. Bare - Bare ground/rock. 
10. Windfarm - Possible shadow evidence of turbines, normally in groups. 
11. Other vegetation - Not covered by the above, e.g. Gorse, Rhododendron, Bracken, Heather etc. 

__Notes:__
a. Species such as Gorse and Rhododendron are not regarded as woodland and have therefore been excluded. 
b. Orchards are not regarded as woodland but have been mapped for carbon accounting purposes. Details can be provided on request. 
c. Interpreted Forest Types are only used to classify polygons in the NFI digital woodland map. IFTs are useful when using the map without the sample data, and for smaller geographic areas where the sample data would be inappropriate. However, for larger geographic areas data on forest types collected in the field is considered to be more accurate, and hence is used for reporting purposes.


### Woodland Grant

The English Woodland Grant Scheme (EWGS) was launched in 2005 and  offered 6 grants for the creation  and stewardship of woodlands.  This dataset contains the scheme or 'case' boundaries that make  up the EWGS applications approved  by the Forestry Commission. EWGS is now closed and  was superseded by Countryside Stewardship in 2015. Grant types under  EWGS: Woodland Planning Grant (WPG) - 'To support  the  preparation of woodland management  plans' Designed primarily to aid  the production of management plans - the foundation of sustainable management. The  management plan template meets UKWAS planning requirements, thus assisting entry into certification.                                                                             
__Woodland Assessment Grant (WAG) - 'To support  information  gathering that improves management decisions'.__

Designed to obtain further information, where  there is an identified need. The information  required should inform management decisions and      reflect the sensitivity  of the site and proposed  work. Woodland Regeneration Grant (WRG) - 'To support  desirable changes in woodland at the time  of  greatest  opportunity'. Designed to support the re-establishment of trees when woodland felling has taken place.  

__Woodland Improvement Grant (WIG) - 'To support capital projects  in woodlands'.__

Designed to support work such  as access tracks, uneconomic thinning, coppicing,  rhododendron clearance and public  access  facilities. 

__Woodland Management Grant (WMG) - 'To support the basic management activities that underpin  woodland sustainability'.__

Designed to support operations that maintain  or enhance the environmental and social value e.g. ride management, pest management, coppicing and uneconomic  thinning. 

__Woodland Creation Grant (WCG) - 'To  support the creation  of properly designed and well  located new woodlands'__

Further information can be found in the  'EWGS General Guide' available from the Forestry  Commission England's website in addition to the Regional  Prospectus for particular grant types:                                                                                                 - http://www.forestry.gov.uk/ There are two spatial datasets associated with the EWGS. These represent the Case Boundary - this dataset - and  the  Sub-compartments that are encapsulated by a case boundary. Sub-compartments  are available as a separate  dataset and contain more detail about the grants awarded to each case.                                                                                                            - EWGS Sub-compartments vs case boundaries: Sub-compartments are the smallest mapped unit of  grant aided area under the EWGS. Sub-compartments are aggregated up to Case Boundaries, and these boundaries are subsequently used to describe the overall extent of the EWGS case. A single case represents one application from an applicant for grant aid, and there may be a number  of different grant types contained within a single case. All boundaries for cases that have been approved (and  were not subsequently withdrawn without payment) from the inception of the EWGS are contained in this dataset. Some cases have passed out of the  obligation period of the contract  which they are under. These cases have a case status of  'Closed'. Attributes: CaseRef = EWGS Case  unique  identifier PropName = The case  name FSArea = The Forestry Commission  Area who dealt with the case CaseType = The case  type DateApprv = The date the  case was approved by the Forestry  Commission CurrStat = The status of the case at the time the data  was  created AreaHa = Area in hectares of the case 

### Ancient Woodland

This is a spatial dataset that describes the geographic extent and location of ancient woodland habitat in England (excluding the Isles of Scilly). Ancient woodland is land that has had a continuous woodland cover since at least 1600 AD and may be ancient semi-natural woodland (ASNW), which retains a native tree and shrub cover that has not been planted, although it may have been managed by coppicing or felling and allowed to regenerate naturally, or plantation on ancient woodland sites (PAWS) where the original tree cover has been felled and replaced by planting, often with conifers, and usually over the last century. In total 53,238 polygons were captured, covering approximately 364,414.53 Ha.
